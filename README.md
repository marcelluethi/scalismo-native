# Scalismo-native - Native libraries packaging for Scalismo

[Scalismo](https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo/) is a library for statistical shape modeling and model-based image analysis in Scala.

The scalismo-native project provides a build framework for packaging the native libraries needed by Scalismo into a single Java jar that can
be used on Linux, Windows and MacOS platforms.

ATTENTION: This project will probably only build (or rather: publish) properly on a Linux system!
